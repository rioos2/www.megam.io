## Scaling

Scaling is the ability to expand or contrast nodes into a group or cluster and/or increase
system resources per node either via CPU cores and/or memory capacity on the fly, by a
schedule or automate via analytics and/or machine learning.

### Horizontal Scaling

Has the adaptability to “cloud burst” (ie - automate expansion and contrasting of nodes in a
cluster during off/peak hours in order to maximize system performance whilst also
minimalizing overall costs), as well as integrate into machine learning and and analytics to
add or remove nodes.


### Vertical Scaling

Increase or decrease system resources to each node on the fly in order to meet minimum
system requirements. Vertical scaling is useful for application lifecycles, updates, upgrades
as well as many other use cases.
